Play begins with a Setup Phase and then continues with repeated Rounds of combat.

Each Round of Combat is made up of the following Phases:
1. **Draw phase**, in which players get a new hand of cards.
2. **Initiative phase**, in which player order is determined.
3. **Resolution phase**, in which players take Turns using their cards.
4. **Scoring phase**, in which players earn Score tokens for causing damage.

## Setup
1. Place the pile of Score tokens to the side of the play area
2. Each player takes a deck of Action cards.
3. Build the Initiative deck by combining two of each player's color, and the Special Initiative card.
4. Each player draws a random Style card from the deck.
5. Place the pile of Power tokens to the side of the play area.
6. Begin play in the Draw Phase.
