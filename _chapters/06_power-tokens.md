Sections can contain a {% include icon_image.html link='files/images/icon-power-up.png' %} or {% include icon_image.html link='files/images/icon-power-down.png' %} symbol.

If a section has a {% include icon_image.html link='files/images/icon-power-down.png' %} symbol on it, then a Power token must be spent to use the effect.
If a player does not have the required Power token, then that section cannot be used.

For each {% include icon_image.html link='files/images/icon-power-up.png' %} symbol in a section, the player gains one Power token.
